# Overview
Welcome to my repository! This repository contains all the material that I need for my presentation of bash scripting tips and tricks for the i-ASK center and users of the Roar supercomputer. We use bash all the time, but not that many people understand just how powerful bash is. The main points I am covering are the following:

* The origin and history of bash
* Why does bash dominate the Unix/Linux scene?
* The basics of bash scripting
* How you can use bash to make your workflow on Roar more efficient

Bash is not something you want to sleep on! Bash is practically the backbone of every batch server, and you can do pretty much anything you can do in other languages with bash. You can also use bash to automate repetitive tasks so you can spend more time on your research. If you are looking to learn how to utilize the full potential of the bash shell, then this presentation is for you!

# Presentation
This presentation is named *Bash Scripting Tips and Tricks*. While it has a cutesy name, we will be taking an in-depth analysis into bash and learning how powerful this open-source, free interactive shell really is. There may be newer, modern shells out there, such as `fish` or `zsh`, but they are no where near as universal as bash is. Used as the main shell in virtually all Linux Distros, bash is a powerful tool to be reckoned with!

In this presentation, we will be learning how to use bash to make your workflow on the Roar supercomputer more efficient. We will also be diving into the basics of bash scripting, and we will also be learning about the history of bash's development. I hope you're ready to learn because I sure am!

# Notes

These are just my markdown notes to help me stay organized while going through the Bash Scripting Tips and Tricks presentation. Feel free to view my notes to see where I am at during the presentation! You can find my notes in the `notes` directory of this repository.

# Examples

These are the example bash scripts that I will be using throughout the Bash Scripting Tips and Tricks presentation. I will have a lot of examples here because I want to show off the absolute power of the bash shell. Feel free to use these scripts as point of reference for when you're developing your own bash scripts!
